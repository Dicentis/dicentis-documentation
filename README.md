# Dicentis Documentation
## User Guide and Developer Documentation

Welcome to Dicentis. This documentation is meant to give users and developers
a guide to follow. A good user guide helps end users to use the plugin and
enables you to create awesome podcasts. The developer documentation is for
developers, which want to extend the plugin with greate add-ons.

Till now, there is not much to see/read here, but this will be changed in near
future.

So stay tune and bookmark this page for later reference :)
